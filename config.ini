## RECEIVERS
##
## Receivers receive notifications about products that are available.
## They notify their listeners, who may request products be downloaded.

##
## Senders send products to hubs for Product Creators.

###
## INDEXER
##
## The indexer is a more useful listener that keeps track of received products,
## builds a catalog, and provides meaningful information about how that catalog is
## changing.  The indexer eliminates duplicates and determines which products are
## considered preferred.
